# Encrypt-Decrypt-Python
There are two files one is Named Encr_File.py and the other one Decr_File. Encr_File.py can be used to encrypt a file with a key you set. Decr_File.py is used to decrypt the file you just encrypted with the same key.

# Info
*You need to place the files in the same folder with the file that is going to be encrypted/decrypted.
*Remember the key you enter so that you can decrypt the files later.
*Tested on Windows but works with every platform even android.
*Python 3.x.x
